# Atrilab_project
This project was an assignment given to me from atrilabs, where I have to make a website clone using the Atrilab editor.
Atrilabs provide a full-stack framework and makes it easier for devlopers to work with CSS.
I worked making a website clone using this frmaework and it was much easier than typing a code for css, I would look forward working with web development using this 
framework. 
Please check on the project, its just the frontend, I will soon start working with the responsiveness of the page using atrilabs.
